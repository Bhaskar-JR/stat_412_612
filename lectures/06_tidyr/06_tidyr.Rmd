# Learning Objectives

- What is tidy data?
- Learn to make your data tidy with `gather()`, `spread()`, `separate()`, and
  `unite()`.
- Chapter 12 of [RDS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#import)

# Tidy Data

- Recall:

    - Observations/units/subjects/individuals/cases:
      objects described by a set of data (e.g. cars, people, countries).
    - Variable: describes some characteristic of the units (e.g. mpg, age, GDP).
    - Each unit has a single value of each variable (e.g. 20 mpg, 31 years old, 
      $20,513,000 US$million).

- Tidy Data:

    - One unit per row. 
    - One variable per column.
    - One value per cell.
    
- Hadley's visualization:

    ![](tidy-1.png)\ 

    
- We will use the tidyr package (a member of the tidyverse) to make data
  tidy.

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

- Example of tidy data:

    ```{r}
    tidyr::table1
    ```
    
    - Variables: Country, Year, Cases, Population
    - Units: location$\times$time

- Untidy data: Each unit is spread across multiple rows

    ```{r}
    print(tidyr::table2, n = 12)
    ```
    
- Untidy data: Two variables are in one column

    ```{r}
    tidyr::table3
    ```
    
- Untidy data: Data are spread across two data frames. Within each data frame,
  multiple units are in one row.

    ```{r}
    tidyr::table4a
    tidyr::table4b
    ```
    
- Sometimes it is easy to determine the units and the variables.

- Sometimes it is very hard and you need to talk to the data collectors to 
  find out.
  
- We want tidy data because R easily manipulates vectors. So in the long run 
  it will make your life easier to first make data tidy.
    
# Gather

- Problem: One variable spread across multiple columns.

- Column names are actually *values* of a variable

- `table4a` and `table4b`

- Solution: `gather()`

- Hadley's visualization:

    ![](./tidy-9.png)\ 

- Specify

    i. The columns that are values, not variables,
    ii. The name of the variable that will take the values of the column names 
        (`key`), and
    iii. The name of the variable that will take the values spread in the cells 
         (`value`).
  
    ```{r}
    tidyr::table4a %>%
      gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "Year", value = "cases") ->
      tidy4a
    tidy4a
    ```
    
    ```{r}
    tidyr::table4b %>%
      gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "Year", value = "population") ->
      tidy4b
    tidy4b
    ```
    
- We will learn next class how to join these two data frames next week. But
  the code is
  
    ```{r}
    full_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
    ```
  
  
- **Exercise** (RDS 12.3.3.1): Why does this code fail?

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    table4a %>% 
      gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
    ```

    ```{block, echo = FALSE}
    1999 and 2000 are prohibited variable names. You can get around this by
    surrounding them with backticks.
    ```

# Spread

- Problem: One observation is spread across multiple rows.

- One column contains variable names. One column contains values for the 
  different variables.

- `table2`

- Solution: `spread()`

- Hadley's visualization:

    ![](./tidy-8.png)\

- Specify:
    
    i. The column that contains the column names (`key`), and 
    ii. The column that contains the values (`value`).

    ```{r}
    table2 %>%
      spread(key = type, value = count)
    ```

- **Exercise** (RDS 13.3.3.3): Why does spreading this data frame fail?

    ```{r}
    people <- tribble(
      ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
      #-----------------|--------|------
      "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
      "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
      "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
      "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
      "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
    )
    ```
    
    ```{block, echo = FALSE}
    There is a duplicate row for "Phillip Woods" and "Age". So in the 
    "Phillip Woods" row and "age" column, should we put in 45 or 50? `spread()`
    doesn't know what to do so it throws an error.
    ```


# Separate

- Problem: One column contains two (or more) variables.

- `table3`

- Solution: `separate()`

- Hadley's visualization:

    ![](./tidy-17.png)\
    
- Specify:

    i. The column that contains two (or more) variables,
    ii. A character vector of the new names of the variables, and
    iii. The character that separates variables (or the position that
         separates variables).
         
    ```{r}
    table3 %>%
      separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
    ```

# Unite

- Problem: One variable spread across multiple columns.

- Solution: `unite()`

- Hadley's visualization:

    ![](./tidy-18.png)\
    
- Much less common problem.

    ```{r}
    table5
    ```

- Specify:

    i. The name of the new column (`col`),
    ii. The columns to unite, and
    iii. The separator of the variables in the new column (`sep`).

    ```{r}
    table5 %>%
      unite(century, year, col = "Year", sep = "")
    ```
