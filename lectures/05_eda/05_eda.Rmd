# Learning Objectives

- Strategies for EDA
- Chapter 7 of [RDS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

# General Strategies

- Plot the distribution of every variable.
- Plot the bivariate distribution of every pair of variables (to find which
  variables are associated).
- Color code by variables to try and see if relationships can be explained.
- Calculate lots of summary statistics.
- Look at missingness.
- Look at outliers.
- EDA is about **curiosity**. Ask *many* questions, use *many* plots, 
  investigate *many* aspects of your data. This will let you hone in on 
  the few *interesting* questions you want to pursue deeper.
  
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data("diamonds")
```

  
# Distribution of Every Variable:

- Quantitative: Use a histogram.
    
    - Look for modality. Indicates multiple groups of units. What can explain 
      the modes? Can any of the other variables explain the modes?
    - Are certain values more likely than other values?
    - Look for skew. 
    - Does it make sense to think of these data on the log scale? For example, 
      do you expect to see about the same number of units in the two adjacent 
      bins of (i) [1,2) and [2,3) or (ii) [1, 10) 
      and [10, 100)? You should log in case (ii) and not log in case (i).
    - `geom_histogram()`
    - [Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean), 
      [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median), 
      [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation),
      [five number summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary).

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 500)
    
    fivenum(diamonds$carat)
    mean(diamonds$carat)
    sd(diamonds$carat)
    ```

- Categorical: Use a bar chart. Or just a table of *proportions* (`table()` then
  `prop.table()`).

    - Absolute counts are sometimes interesting, but usually you want to 
      look at the proportion of observations in each category.
    - Is there a natural ordering of the categories (bad, medium, good)?
    - Why are some categories more represented than others?
    - `geom_bar()`, `geom_col()`
    - Proportion of observations within each group.
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color, y = ..)) +
      geom_bar(aes(y = ..count.. / sum(..count..))) +
      ylab("Proportion")
    
    table(diamonds$color)
    prop.table(table(diamonds$color))
    ```

# Bivariate Distribution of Every Pair of Variables

- Quantitative vs Quantitative: Use a scatterplot
    
    - Is the relationship linear? Quadratic? Exponential?
    - Logging is useful tool to make some associations linear. 
      If the relationship is (i) monotonic and (ii) curved, then try logging 
      the x-variable *if the x-variable is all positive*.
      If it is also (iii) more variable at larger y-values, then try logging
      the y-variable *instead* of the x-variable *if the y-variable is all 
      positive*. Try logging both if you still
      see curvature *if both variables are all positive*.
    - Ask if an observed association can be explained by another variable?
    - Correlation coefficient (only appropriate if association is linear). 
    - Kendall's tau (always appropriate).
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_y_log10() +
      scale_x_log10()
    
    cor(diamonds$carat, diamonds$price)
    ## cor(diamonds$carat, diamonds$price, method = "kendall")
    ```
    
- Categorical vs Quantitative: Use a boxplot

    - For which levels of the categorical variable is the quantitative variable
      higher or lower?
    - For which levels is the quantitative variable more spread out?
    - Aggregated means, medians, standard deviations, quantiles
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color, y = price)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      scale_y_log10()
    
    diamonds %>%
      mutate(logprice = log(price)) %>%
      group_by(color) %>%
      summarize(mean   = mean(logprice), 
                sd     = sd(logprice), 
                median = median(logprice),
                Q1     = quantile(logprice, 0.25), 
                Q3     = quantile(logprice, 0.75))
    ```
    

- Categorical vs Categorical: Use a mosaic plot or a count plot

    - For which pairs of values of the categorical variables are there the most number of 
      units?
    - Does the conditional distribution of a categorical variable change
      at different levels of the other categorical variable?
    - `prop.table()`

    ```{r}
    ## Only gives you the bivariate distribution
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = color)) +
      geom_count()
    
    ## Gives you the conditional distributions of color given cut
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) +
      geom_bar(position = "fill")
    
    ## Gives you the conditional distributions of cut given color
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
      geom_bar(position = "fill")
    
    ## Bivariate Distribution
    prop.table(table(diamonds$color, diamonds$cut))
    
    ##  Conditional distributions of column variable conditional on row variable
    prop.table(table(diamonds$color, diamonds$cut), margin = 1)
    
    ## Conditional distributions of row variable conditional on column variable
    prop.table(table(diamonds$color, diamonds$cut), margin = 2)
    ```
