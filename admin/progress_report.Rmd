# Progress Report

- Submit a 2-page progress report.

- Figures do not contribute to the page limits.

- Your report should be written in R Markdown and knitted to PDF. The names of all group members should be at the top of the page.

- Provide the following details:
    1. What peer-reviewed articles are you including in your report? Summarize each in 1-2 sentences.
    2. Describe the work you've done so far. For each submitted hypothesis, provide some evidence that you are making initial explorations. This could, for example, be in the form of a plot or a table of summary statistics.
    3. Write a paragraph on your next steps.
